## Creating a new client mapper

1. Create a new client mapper class that extends the raw infringement mapper service
2. Implement the required methods to convert the raw data to create/update dtos
3. Add if statements to the raw infringement identifier service functions to extract issuer code and notice number code to be saved on the raw infringement being saved
